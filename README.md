# Team
## BigDataCache

# Team Members:
+ Alex Young - Team documentation and data gatherer  
+ Kevin Hsu - Hosted the VS code, found .Json libraries  
+ Will Nelson - Developed the React and js code base for visualizing the geolocation data  
+ Jarod Guerrero - made a a ReactJS Nav bar and learned a lot about js and react code  
+ Daniel Yan - Developed React and .js code base for visualization and the color coding for income levels  

# Summary:
+ Used **ReactJS** for the frontend, primarily the **React-Leaflet** library and **VS Code Liveshare** for team collaboration.
+ Cross-platform webpage with nice display 
+ Used OpenStreetMap API to display the entire world map and have scaleable Google Maps-type map depiction.
+ Using *.json* libraries from *data.gov* and King County API's our team created a website that shows income levels by zipcode.
+ Used multiple *.js*, *.css*, and *.html* files to create a website
+ This website represented data of income across **every zipcode** in King County
+ Also worked on correlating college tuition to median income levels in each zipcode in King County

# Conclusion:
+ The team worked very hard for over 12 hours in this rigorous hackathon
+ There were multiple breaks for different workshops and we all gained a lot of knowledgs and experience working in teams
+ Only a couple of us knew each other but we were able to collaborate effectively to create a fucntioning and practical website
+ This Website can be used by students that will help them pick which area to live in based on median income and the related tuition costs
+ The project came down to the wire but we were able to finish and present to the rest of the Hackathon members
+ In the future we hope to expand this project to wider area but the amount of data we were sorting through and trying to find slowed us down immensely.
